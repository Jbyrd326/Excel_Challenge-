Question1:
With the given data provided from previous successful, unsuccessful, canceled and even live crowdfunding campaigns we can see that that crowdfunding is more commonly used in the U.S in comparison to any other Country referenced in the data set (AU, CA, CH, DK, GB, IT) thus helping us understand what country may be best suited to run a crowdfunding campaign in. Although we can conclude there may be a greater relationship in terms of amount, we can still see that there is pretty much a similar trend in terms success rate regardless of Country.

Another conclusion that can be drawn from the data set is that majority, nearly 70% of the crowdfunding campaigns were in some relation to the "arts" (Music, Film/Video and Theatre) based on the Parent Categories. In addition, if we were to get an average success rate for each of the 3 Parent Category Leaders in regard to amounts of successful campaigns ran (Music, Film/Video, Theatre) we would get an average success rate of 56%. Now 56% is more than half but is it the best? If we were to take an aggregate success rate from the field and look at all 9 Parent Categories, we would see that the 56% success rate, we get from the most commonly ran crowdfund campaigns is below the aggregated total success rate from all 9 Parent Categories which is 61.3%. So which Parent Category had the highest success rate you ask? Well, it just so happens to be the Parent Category with the next highest successfully ran crowdfund campaign and that is Tech at 68%.

Furthermore, a final conclusion that we can draw looking at our graphs created from our data set is when is the best time to run our Crowdfunding Campaign? There are highs and lows to both the successful & unsuccessful campaign’s but we want to pinpoint the most opportune time in which we can have success. Looking at our graph (sheet3) we can see that there are upward trends in March, June, July & September for successful crowdfunding campaigns. Now looking at the unsuccessful crowdfunding campaigns we are looking to see downward trends in the same month we see upward trends, which will bring us to the conclusion that it's best to run our crowdfund campaign in the months of June and September and we would look to stay away from the months May & August specifically to give us the best shot of success.

Question2:
Some limitations that we may have with this data set is that we are potentially missing out on some additional variables that may also play a role in the success of a Crowdfunding Campaign.

Question 3:
Not sure if any will present the information better but a Pie chart is another possible graph/chart that could’ve been used to present the data to provide a more visual effect on perceived gaps between categories. Another may be a variance graph, not sure what the graph is properly called but I remember you using it when we discussed variances in the class but that would be a good table to use to try to stick with the determining factors that align with a successful crowdfunding campaign that hug closer to the line and are further up or down the graph. 

Mean or Median:
For this example, the data that is listed in sheet 5 I believe the Median best summarizes the data because I feel as if the averages form the Mean can be a bit skewed due to the fact that one campaign can have we over the amount of backers needed to have a successful Crowdfunding Campaign. 

Determine Variability:
Based on the data presented it looks as if there is more variability with successful campaigns than there are with unsuccessful campaigns looking at how the both the variance and the standard deviation of the number of backers are higher for on the successful campaigns than they are for the unsuccessful ones.
